# xmppautomater
GUI based application to automate inter-domain XMPP federation configuration between Cisco IM&P  servers.  

I had to do the XMPP federation configuration between IM&P clusters frequently and wanted to automate it end to end so I can just click a button and sit.
Don't think anyone else would need it but drop a email incase you need an up to date version.
